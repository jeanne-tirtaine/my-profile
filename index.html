	    <p>
		I love to travel all around the world and had the chance to travel a lot with my family. I've visited incredible countries, in Europe, Africa, America and Asia. Travels are real chances to discover new cultures and lifestyles. It is also a great opportunity to discover new people with different visions of life.

	    <p>
		Fashion has always been a real passion to me, I even considered for a very long time studying fashion instead of business. I love to sew, to create and imagine designs. Creating my own brand would be a dream of mine !

	     <p>
		Dancing is a universal language that everyone gets. I started dancing when I was 6 and immediatly fell in love with it. It's a time when I can relax and let every bad felling, bad emotion out and transform it into something beautiful.
